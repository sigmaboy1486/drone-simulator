# drone-simulator
This project presents a 3D Drone Projectile Motion Simulator that combines physics-based modeling with real-time interactive web visualization. The system is designed using a Python Flask backend to perform numerical computations based on classical projectile motion equations, while the frontend utilizes Plotly.
